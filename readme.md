# Friday – Lightweight Intelligent AI Assistant

---

## Overview

Friday is a lightweight yet powerful AI assistant powered by Large Language Model (LLM) APIs. It is designed to deliver accurate, fast, and natural conversational responses to user queries without requiring heavy backend infrastructure. The goal is to showcase how a small-scale generative AI assistant can be implemented in under 8 days while maintaining correctness, efficiency, and scalability.

## Project Idea

The aim of Friday is to act as an intelligent conversational partner capable of:

1. Answering general knowledge questions.

2. Generating creative content (e.g., summaries, emails, ideas).

3. Assisting with day-to-day productivity (reminders, notes, brainstorming).

4. Providing explanations for technical and theoretical topics.

_Since Friday relies on LLM APIs, it doesn’t require training its own AI models; instead, it focuses on effective API integration, context management, and clean UI/UX for end users._
